## Manual 
The program meets all objectives and provides all functionalities specified in the
assignment description.

One assumption that I made while developing the active cell feature is that, given
a occupied cell with pre-existing bars, growing or shrinking the bars will not change
the colour of that cell. More specifically, if the current colour is red on an empty
cell, moving the active cell to a previously yellow bar or changing the height of the
cell will not change the colour unless the user clicks on the radio button.
